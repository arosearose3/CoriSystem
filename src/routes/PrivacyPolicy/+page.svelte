    <p>Cori Colorado Referral Information (“Cori,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy” or “Policy”) is designed to help you understand how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you use Cori websites, applications, or other online services we provide (collectively, the “Services”).</p>
